Objectives: 
• Develop an RL agent that controls traffic signals in a simulated environment. 
• Achieve at least a 25% reduction in average vehicle wait time compared to a standard 
fixed-timer controller within the simulation. 
• Create a dashboard to visualize the agent's performance and the live traffic flow. 

• Scope: 
    The project will focus on a single, simulated four-way intersection. The agent's 
training and evaluation will be done entirely within this simulation.

Technology Stack: 
• Simulation: SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility) 
• Backend & AI: Python, TensorFlow or PyTorch, FastAPI 
• Frontend: React.js
